            <p>Why attend?</p>
            <p>The MAVRIC conference is the first conference in the DC region that brings together the governmental decision-makers, the corporate and independent developers, and the researchers pushing the boundaries of the possible in AR, VR, and MR. 
            Based at the University of Maryland, a top 5 ranked school in Graphics and Visualization, Computer Vision, and several other fundamental technologies underlying Virtual and Augmented Reality, we will be offering regional and national leaders a chance to exchange knowledge, network, and build partnership around Immersive Media. 
            Ready to attend, but need to convince your boss? Use our pre-prepared letter to make your pitch.

                        <p>Immersive Media has an enormous potential for changing how, when, and where we train and re-train our workers. It used to be that you needed
                        to be training 10,000+ for a Virtual training program to really be cost effective, that number has dropped by 2 orders of magnitude already and 
                        is well on the way to dropping another. How are you preparing to provide truly individualized, responsive learning environments for your people? 
                        How are you preparing to provide on-the-job tools that improve efficiency and accuracy across a wide spectrum of activities and roles?.</p>
